Project Description:

An interactive web browsers game that dynamically updates the HTML using the jQuery library.

Here's how the app works:

o There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

o The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

o When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

  * Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
  * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

o The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

o The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

o The game restarts whenever the player wins or losses.

  * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
o The app should show the number of games the player wins and losses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.

  * The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.
  * Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
